    <title>The Best Mother Fucking Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>The <i>best</i> motherfucking website</h1>
    <p>For real.</p>
    <h2>Styling?</h2>
    <p> You probably build websites using vim and you think that's hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <span
            class="red">motherfuckingwebsite</span>(.com)
        is going to get you some award to put on your damn footer as a link.
        You think your default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p>
    <p>Well, guess what, you're <span class="underlined_orange">WRONG</span>, motherfucker.</p>
    <h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>
    <p>Let me describe the <i>real</i> perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <span
            class="red">motherfuckingwebsites</span>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
        <li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href="https://google.com/">Google home page</a></li>
        <li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your 16x32 Tamagotchi, I'm sorry)</li>
        <li>Looks <i>almost</i> the same on every screen</li>
        <li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem <span class="small_text">well, kind of</span></li>
        <li>It's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">accessible</a>, so everyone can enjoy it <span class="small_text">but not
                everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</span></li>
        <li>Shit is <i>even more</i> legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style
            without looking like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a> website</li>
        <li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers">IPoAC</a></li>
        <li>Uses only free and open-source resources, like this awesome font called "Open Sans" <small>which btw weighs
                15.21kB, wtf</small></li>
        <li>It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any
            other framework. This website is proudly made with plain HTML5, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!</li>
        <li>Doesn't include any tracking service</li>
        <li>Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available <i>JUST USE IT</i>.</li>
        <li>Use <i>some</i> fucking <span class="rainbow">colors</span>.</li>
        <li>Links don't really need to keep that <span class="blue">shitty blue</span> the browser is giving them: nor
            that <span class="purple">violetish color</span> when they are marked as visited. Just give them a <a
                href="http://www.colorhexa.com/0077aa">nice color</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h2>
    <p>This website is even better than the last <a href="../BetterMotherFuckingWebsite/index.html">guy</a> and the <a
            href="../MotherFuckingWebsite/">guy before him</a>.</p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It's over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">secure connection</a> - so nobody can spy what
            we're serving to you (the page might be different for everyone, pshht!).</li>
        <li>It uses one of the most general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gTLD">gTLDs</a> available out there:
            .website</li>
        <li>It uses the TLD, too: thebestmotherfucking.website, check out <a href="http://domainr.com/">domainr</a> to
            do something cool too.</li>
        <li>It uses the kickass <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> CA (don't you see the gorgeous
            lock?)</li>
        <li>It uses <a href="js/jquery-3.5.1.min.js">a custom version</a> of the awesome <a
                href="http://jquery.com/">ultra-lightweight jQuery</a> <b>/s</b></li>
        <li>It probably doesn't support all the web browsers, but that's the best thing - if the user's browser is
            outdated they will notice and maybe they will switch from <a href="https://microsoft.com/ie">the crap they
                use</a> to <a href="https://mozilla.com/firefox">a much cooler browser</a></li>
        <li>It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript <img class="languages_logo" src="img/javascript.svg"
                title="JavaScript logo" alt="Javascript Logo">, CSS3 <img class="languages_logo" src="img/css3.svg"
                title="CSS3 logo" alt="CSS3 Logo"> and HTML5 <img  class="languages_logo" src="img/html5.svg"
                title="HTML5 Logo" alt="HTML5 Logo"></li>
        <li>Freaks who are scared of JavaScript will feel safe here since the website doesn't need to have JS enabled to
            be properly rendered</li>
        <li>It supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">HTTP/2</a></li>
        <li>It includes a Cache-Control header, so you don't waste your precious bandwidth if you visit the website more
            than once</li>
        <li>It allows universal access from every website via <a href="https://enable-cors.org/">CORS</a></li>
        <li>It is <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php">Accessible</a></li>
        <li>It is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, making it <a
                href="https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/gtld/website/">almost free</a> to keep this website
            alive</li>
        <li>It's Open Source, freely available on <a
                href="https://github.com/denysvitali/thebestmotherfuckingwebsite/">GitHub</a>, and everybody can
            contribute to it.</li>
        <li>It uses the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/">WTFPL - Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License</a>, which
            is pretty clear on what you can and what you can't do:<p class="listinlist">0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU
                WANT TO.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Put even less contrast</h2>
    <p>Yeah, a <span class="grey"> <span>xx</span>#444 is cool</span> but a <span class="grey"><span>xx</span>#454545 is
            better</span>.</p>
    <p>We don't need to break our eyes while looking at a <span class="red">motherfuckingwebsite</span>.</p>
    <h2>Size matters, yeah, but don't exaggerate</h2>
    <p> Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a fucking 2 inches letter on a 27 inches
        screen,
        so keep it cool. Don't exaggerate in size, but don't make a text that is only readable by ants.</p>
    <h2>Put some pictures</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="container_figure">
            <figure><img class="container_figure_image" src="img/cat.jpg" title="cute cat" alt="cute cat meowmeow">
                <figcaption>A cat, just to keep the context of the website.</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
        <div class="container_text">
            <p> We're not looking at a novel by Stephenie Meyer, this is a <span
                    class="red">motherfuckingwebsite</span>.
                Add some relevant pictures to give a little bit of context, or to cheer up the reader.
                Do you really like to waste the power of technology that we have nowadays? Come on, you're using a
                web browser on a computer, you're not reading a book on a Kindle.</p>
            <p>The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it should make the user happy while reading your
                nonsense words.</p>
            <p>You see the picture of this cute cat? He's happy, and you should be too.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Yes, even this is satire.</h2>
    <p> But this doesn't mean you should load your <span class="red">motherfuckingwebsite</span> with shitty animations.
        Keep it simple, minify its resources and use images responsibly.
        Remember the IPoAC users, less requests (with a small size) = faster load time!
        Oh and by the way, this doesn't mean that you should use webpack and put everything in a 10MB main.js file,
        there are people out there who are still using 56k modems and haven't
        tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_to_the_x#FTTH">futuristic technologies</a>!</p>
    <blockquote><span>"Good design is as little design as possible.</span><br>
        <span>- Some German motherfucker on motherfuckingwebsite.com</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>That's not entirely true, look at that <span class="red">motherfuckingwebsite</span>.
        It's so minimal that it seems like I'm reading the <i>txt</i> version of the
        <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5321.txt">SMTP RFC (RFC5321)</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Epilogue</h2>
    <p> Actually this website was made to follow the trend of the <a href="../MotherFuckingWebsite/index.html"class="red">motherfuckingwebsite></a>
        and the <a href="../BetterMotherFuckingWebsite/" class="red">bettermotherfuckingwebsite></a>.
        Despite the criticism here, they're beautiful and truly among the best websites on the internet
        (even though this is still <span class="red">thebestmotherfuckingwebsite</span>), so go check 'em out.
        Nevertheless, this shows that the internet has taken a really wrong turn - I honestly miss
        the time when websites were made to convey information. At least, thanks god, we
        got rid of pop-ups.</p>
    <p>Seriously, follow some of the advice we gave you, they'll "make the web great again"</p>
    <h2>Author</h2>
    <p>This website was created by an annoyed developer that can <a href="https://x.com/DenysVitali">be followed on
            X</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/">followed on GitHub</a> or contacted <a href="https://denv.it/">here,
            on his ultra-minimalist website</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p>The cat picture was taken from the cool <a href="https://pixabay.com/">Pixabay</a> website: check it out, it's
        really cool and full of CC0 (aka Public Domain) content.
        The author was 1899441 on Pixabay (seriously? That username looks like my PIN code!), but that account seems to
        be gone now. The <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/cat-pets-cat-s-eyes-mieze-dear-451377/">old picture</a> was
        by <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/users/aloiswohlfahrt-123449/">aloiswohlfahrt</a>,
        but I had to change it, cause it was too heavy and too cute.
        You can <a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/thebestmotherfuckingwebsite/issues/new">open an issue on
            GitHub</a> if you think that this decision goes against the rules
        of a good looking <span class="red">motherfuckingwebsite</span>.
